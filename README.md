Using HotpotQA, a Dataset for Diverse, Explainable Multi-hop Question Answering. I read, analized the paper Cognitive Graph for Multi-Hop Reading Comprehension at Scale, tried to run the Github codes. 

And finally implemented it, also made a slide and a report for understanding it.

Codes and comments are all displayed in \Code\Implement.ipynb file. You can also check our report on \Reports, including Powerpoint slides and PDF files for more details.
